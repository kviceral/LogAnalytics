# LogAnalytics
Programming Kata: Given an apache log file, show the unique requests per hour.

##Demo
TBD

##Info
Reading up Quora when I saw an interesting [problem](http://qr.ae/7ApmM1). 
>Given an arbitrary set of webserver log files in the industry-standard Common Log Format, produce a histogram of the number of unique page views per hour.  The solution may be written in any language or combination of languages. You may use any and all resources at your disposal to solve this problem.

It seemed like a great opportunity to play around with some technologies. I could have probably done it a lot faster with a different stack but where's the fun in that?
Small list of some technologies/workflow used:
* Spring Boot (Web
* Angular
* Grok
* Chart JS
* Bower
* TDD
* Github
* Docker

##How To Build
Download the project, import into your IDE, install bower components, run spring boot (LogAnalyticsApplication.java)

##How To Deploy
TBD
